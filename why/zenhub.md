# Boards

Boards are great for organizing, prioritizing and tracking issues in one or many milestones, across one or many repositories. The board organizes issues into pipelines (I.E. Triage, TODO, In Progress, In Review, Done) to help visualize the status of issues being displayed.

# Burndown Chart

The burndown chart helps visualize your teams cadence over the course of a heartbeat. Each issue in a heartbeat can be assigned a numeric "estimate" value, which is a measure of the relative difficulty of the work. The burndown chart uses this information to graph the total amount of work over time.
