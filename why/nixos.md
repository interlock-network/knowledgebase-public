# NixOS
We use NixOS because it is more reliable. It simplifies deployments.

- It ensures our deployments work the same across system upgrades.
- Reliabilty: we will not spend time troubleshooting breaks in the
  system due to upgrades.
- Consistency: the entire system is configured using a common
  language.
- Configuration: All configuration is stored in a single place, there
  is a single point of truth.
- Version control: The system state can be declared and persisted in a
  functional manner using version control.
