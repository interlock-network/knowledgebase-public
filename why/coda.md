# Coda
Coda is our way of avoiding lost knowledge by combining it with our knowledge base here in Github. 
It is a new kind of doc that brings words, data, and teams together. 
It comes with a set of building blocks that anyone can combine to create a doc as powerful as an app.
For niche focuses such as; Product teams, Meetings, Enterprises, Small businesses, Startups,
OKRs, Knowledge management, Sales; along with multiple packs for integration. 

Our adoption of this is still a work in progress.
