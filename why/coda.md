# Coda
Coda is our way of avoiding lost knowledge by combining it with our knowledge base here in Github. 
It is a new kind of doc that brings words, data, and teams together. 
It comes with a set of building blocks that anyone can combine to create a doc as powerful as an app.
For niche focuses such as; Product teams, Meetings, Roadmaps, Content Calendars, Team Policy,
OKRs, Knowledge management, Sales. Along with multiple packs for integration and nifty things like 
tables that talk to each other and buttons that take action.


Our adoption of this is still a work in progress.
