# Where

Articles about where certain things are. Not sure if we will be using
this category, but I included it form completeness. It was definitely
more relevant pre-pandemic, when we had an actual office, and actual
cafes and obscure hole-in-the-wall food-places to frequent.

Even so, feel free to drop anything from your local area that you want to
make a note of. Also, feel free to drop in any virtual-spaces, like
zoom-rooms, discord-channels, IRC channels, and so on.
