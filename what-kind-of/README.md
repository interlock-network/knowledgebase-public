# What Kind Of
This is the closest thing we have to wikipedia's Categories
or Portals. For example, the article `security` would link to
other security related articles, as well as describing the various
kinds of `security` available. An article on `consensus` would link
specific articles about consensus algorithms, and also contain a
summary about the kinds of consensus, and categorize/sort those
linked-to articles.

In general we aggregate related articles (from any of the other categories),
and summarize the _relationship_ between those articles.
