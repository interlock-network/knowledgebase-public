## What kind of Tech Stack is Interlock using for development? 

We're using Rust+Solana for smart-contracts, Python+cadCAD for token-modeling, javascript+uBlock for our extension-code, 
a mixture of type-script and node.js (javascript) for our backend-code that handles data analysis and heuristics, 
and python for various other things like the [Bouncer](https://github.com/interlock-network/interlock-bouncer-documentation) discord bot. 
All these components together make up the Interlock network.
