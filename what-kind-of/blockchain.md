## Blockchain 

A blockchain in the simplest terms is a system where transactions made on a cryptocurrency can be maintained across multiple computers that are 
linked in some form of a peer-to-peer network. Interlock Network is built on top of the Solana and Ethereum blockchains. We will provide public files with 
information about our [Solana-contracts](https://github.com/interlock-network/INTR-smartcontracts/tree/master/solana-contracts) and 
[Solana-resources](https://github.com/interlock-network/INTR-smartcontracts/tree/master/solana-resources) for transparency about our contract development.
We will also provide files with information about our 
[Ethereum-contracts](https://github.com/interlock-network/INTR-smartcontracts/tree/master/ethereum-contracts) and 
[Ethereum-resources](https://github.com/interlock-network/INTR-smartcontracts/tree/master/ethereum-resources). All of these files can be found in our 
[INTR-smartcontracts](https://github.com/interlock-network/INTR-smartcontracts) repo where we will host development of all smart contracts 
that actualize our token model and DeSec infrastructure.
