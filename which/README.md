# Which
This is a category about choices and dilemmas. For example,
an article called `blockchain` would present a comparison of
blockchain, their strengths and weaknesses, their history,
and why we chose one or another (or multiple). There is clearly
some overlap with the `why/` category, but this category can also
include why other people/organizations favor a certain technology
or product. The `which/knowledge-base` article should be interesting.
Also `which/browser` might be of interest to someone.
