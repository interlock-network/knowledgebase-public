# GDPR

The GDPR is a privacy law from the EU that basically affects all jurisdictions
(it is cheaper to comply globally than on a per-region basis). The GDPR has
always been relevant to the tech industry, but it is especially relevant to
blockchain. Most blockchains are transparent, which contradicts the GDPR's
notions of privacy and consumer protection.

We're going to have to stay abreast of developments here.
