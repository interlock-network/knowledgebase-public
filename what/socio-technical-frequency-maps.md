# Socio Technical Frequency Maps

A 2D axis for categorizing systems and tasks.
The X axis goes from Social (left) to Technical, and the Y axis goes
from Slow-Long-Term (bottom) to Fast-Real-Time.

For example, dev-ops is techical/real-time, while machine-learning model-training
is techical/long-term-ish. Basically, anything in that is more technical
than social, and more real-time thant long-term is a task/problem/system
that is best solved/implemented with computers.
