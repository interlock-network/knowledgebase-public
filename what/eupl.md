# EUPL

Imagine if the AGPL was written by someone who was not crazy.
That is the EUPL. It would be to the LGPL what the AGPL is to
the GPL -- in other words it is an ALGPL. So static linking
does not constitute derivation. The distribution-definition
has been adapted to the Cloud and SaaS Era. There is much less
ambiguity in the license. If you modify the repo, it is derivation
-- and anything else is fair game.
