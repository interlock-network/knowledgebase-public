# BSD License
A do-whatever-you-want open source license. Businesses love this
because there is no obligation of reciprocity. It makes legal review
easier, and it also makes it trivial to create a hosted (SaaS) product
which basically manages the open code for you and makes it more accessible.

Increasingly, people (and businesses) are losing their patience with blatant
knock-off-services, and they are choosing either stronger open-source
licenses (i.e. [EUPL](./eupl.md) and [GPL](./agpl.md)),
non-open-source-license (i.e. [SSPL](./what/sspl.md)), or are exploring
post-open-source-licenses (i.e. [Bruce Perens](../who/bruce-perens.md)
began exploring the use _contract law_ (as opposed to copyright law)
which would achieve everything open source would, but would also entitle
the authors of the project to a percentage of revenues from anyone using
the [post-open-source-contract](./post-open-source-contract.md).
