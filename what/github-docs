# Github Docs
Software from github, that lets you create docs that look like docs.github.com.
It uses components and chunks for reuse. However, it is not a replacement for a
[knowledge-base](./knowledge-base.md). It is literally the digital equivalent
of a user-manual -- something that is meant to be read, observed, and obeyed, but
not edited or contributed to.
