# Knowbot # 

This file is for describing what the Knowbot is. It is explained that the knowbot will be able to search for tags, keywords, titles, 
search for only tags in certain directories, search for tags or keywords only in file titles matching certain names, etc, and then it will be 
able to print the files in the discord chat. Additional information is in the [Knowbot repo](https://github.com/interlock-network/knowbot).
