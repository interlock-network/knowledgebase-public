A framework for categorizing contexts and domains, with the goal of helping people 
make better decisions by facilitating an understanding _of_ their own understanding
and perceptions of the context/domain.

# Contexts

There are 4 contexts, connected by a blurry interstitial context called "confusion".
They are:

 - clear
 - complicated
 - complex
 - chaotic
 - confusion
