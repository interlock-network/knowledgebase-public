# Connectivism Learning Theory 

To find additional terminology to explain and help with figuring out details for the ongoing discussion of User to User Mentorship 
in [#50](https://github.com/interlock-network/interlock-kb/discussions/50#discussion-3939190)
the term Connectivism Learning Theory is being explored in this file. 

Connectivism Learning Theory was first introduced by a man, George Siemens, who posted an article discussing the topic denouncing 
boundaries of behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism in 2004. Later, in 2005 he went in and edited the title to, 
"A learning theory for the digital age". 

Western Governors University(WGU) defined it as a learning theory that accepts that technology is a major part of the 
learning process and that our constant connectedness gives us opportunities to make choices about our learning. 
It also promotes group collaboration and discussion, allowing for different viewpoints and 
perspectives when it comes to decision-making, problem-solving, and making sense of information.
Connectivism promotes learning that happens outside of an individual, such as through social media, online networks, blogs, or information databases.
In the context of Interlock, this will be explored as learning that happens not entirely outside of an individual but simultaneously through an individual 
that is on the Interlock Network. But additionally in the context of Interlock, there will always be a network and information database
This needs to continue to be explored and put into better words but for now that is the most general connection. 


In relation to the terms that were used in [#50](https://github.com/interlock-network/interlock-kb/discussions/50#discussion-3939190)
, customer-support network and community-nodes, it is relevant to consider the following reference. 

The [Connectivism Learning Theory](https://www.wgu.edu/blog/connectivism-learning-theory2105.html#close) from WGU states that: 

>What are Nodes and Links in Connectivism?

>According to connectivism, learning is more than our own internal construction of knowledge. 
Rather, what we can reach in our external networks is also considered to be learning. 
From this theory, two terms—nodes and links—have been commonly used to describe how we gain and connect information in a network.
In connectivism, students are seen as “nodes” in a network. A node refers to any object that can be connected to another object, 
like a book, webpage, person, etc. Connectivism is based on the theory that we learn when we make connections, or “links,” 
between various "nodes" of information, and we continue to make and maintain connections to form knowledge.

With this being presented as a way of gaining knowledge, it is important to remember that the User-to-User mentorship idea is one 
that supports our users gaining and sharing knowledge as they acquire achievements/rewards. 
In the eyes of connectivism we will be encouraging our users to not only be "nodes" or students, 
but to also become a "link" on our Interlock network that maintians meaningful connections to gain and share knowledge. 

The original article from, George Siemens, [Connectivism:
A Learning Theory for the Digital Age](https://www.itdl.org/Journal/Jan_05/article01.htm) 
offers additional insight and history on the topic.
