# AGPL

An extended GPL license meant for the Cloud Era and SaaS Era.
It is worded ambiguously, and people still disagree on what it means
(particularly what constitutes derivation). The only real change
from the [GPL](./gpl.md) is that it defines interaction-over-a-network as
"distribution", which means you must make any _changed_ source available.

Businesses do not like it, because lawyers disagree how "viral" the
license is. The GPL, on the other hand is well-understood. A much
less troublesome license (but one with the same goals as the AGPL)
is the [EUPL](./eupl.md).
