# Resulting

Resulting is poker-terminology for (erroneously) assuming causality between
a _decision_ and a _result_. For example, if one makes a (statistically)
sound decision, but gets a bad result, and then assumes that the decision
_itself_ was bad, they are resulting.

For example, if a course of action has 9/10 odds of success, but ends up
failing, the course of action was not _bad_. It was actually good (90% good).
If one categorizes the course of action as inherently _bad_, then
they are _resulting_.
