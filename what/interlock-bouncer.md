# Interlock-Bouncer #

This file is for describing what the Interlock-Bouncer is. "Linkbot" was the temporary name. It is explained in more detail in the [interlock-bouncer repo](https://github.com/interlock-network/interlock-bouncer).

Our latest description:

Interlock-bouncer scans every link posted to Discord for privacy and security risks. If it detects an unsafe link, it'll label it unsafe and post it as a string instead of a link for transparency. Future versions will have options to autoban users who post unsafe links as well as other moderation features.

Interlock-bouncer is powered by Interlock’s proprietary database of unsafe URLs and ‘point-of-click’ ML analysis of novel websites.

Unlike Meebot, you don't have to do any custom scripting -- your server will instantly be protected out of the box from both novel and known malicious links.
