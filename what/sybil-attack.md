# Sybil Attack

A sybil attack is when a single person creates multiple fake accounts
and tries to pass them off as unique individuals. Multiple accounts per
person are a problem in situations that involve consensus/voting, and
resource distribution. In the former, one can gain a disproportionate
voting-advantage by using many sock-puppet-accounts. In the latter,
one can capture a greater share of resources that are meant to be distributed
equitably.

[Quadratic Voting](./quadratic-voting.md) is a very appealing voting-system,
but the Sybil Attack is its achilles heel. [GitCOIN](./gitcoin.md) is a
prominent project that uses quadratic voting, and it has contracted
[BlockScience](../who/blockscience.md) to find ways to mitigate this attack.
They came up with an interesting system powered by [Machine Learning](./machine-learning.md)
to detect and prevent such attacks. Another approach is [proof-of-personhood](./proof-of-personhood.md)
systems like [Upala](./upala.md).
