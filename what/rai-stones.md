# Rai Stones

Rai Stones are variously-sized -- 3.5 centimeters to 3.6 meters in height -- circular, stone disks with engravings.
They are used as currency, decoration, jewelry by the Yapese people of the Yap islands in micronesia.
Because some of them are gigantic and weight a few thousand kilograms, they are difficult to transport.
To facilitate easier transactions, the Yapese maintain a ledger -- via oral-tradition -- of who owns which fraction
of which Rai Stone, not unlike a blockchain.

An interesting case of the use of the ledger to establish ownership over a stone, is when one of these massive stones
was being transported by a ship, and the ship sunk into the middle of the pacific. It was never seen again,
by any other human being -- it might not have even survived as a single piece -- yet, its ownership is still
recorded in the ledger.

In principle, if all of the stones disappeared from the face of the earth, the oral ledger would still contain
a list of who owns what.

Crypto-currencies can be considered as digital Rai Stones -- the value is in the ledger not the actual artifacts.
