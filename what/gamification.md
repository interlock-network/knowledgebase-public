# Gamification 

**Note**

This term is to never be spoken/written inside company documentation because it trivializes what we do. 
Internal terminology will leak externally, and the word sounds sleazy and manipulative, as well as belittling -- we should not belittle ourselves.

Instead we will be exploring terms such as [Connectivism Learning Theory] and others.

Gamification is defined per Webster Dictionary as: 
>The basic concept of gamification isn't new, but the word itself is a 21st-century addition to the English lexicon. 
The word refers to the incorporation of game elements, like point and reward systems, to tasks as incentives for people to participate. 
In other words, gamification is about making something potentially tedious into a game. 
Gamification is effective because it taps into people's natural desires for competition and achievement.

However, there is a clear issue with the term. No two people seem to have the same working definition of gamification. 
It doesn’t help that there are two different types of gamification (‘Structural’ and ‘Content’).
