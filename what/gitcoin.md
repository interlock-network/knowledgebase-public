# Gitcoin

A network that tries to use blockchain to coordinate (and decentralize) crowd-funding
for open source projects hosted on github. Like most such projects, they have
to grapple with similar problems that we are grappling with like [Sybil Attacks](./sybil-attack.md)
and [Proof of Personhood](./proof-of-personhood.md).
