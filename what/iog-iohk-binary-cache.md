# What is an IOG or IOHK binary cache?

### IOG (Input Output Global):

IOG, formerly known as IOHK (Input Output Hong Kong), is a research and development company instrumental in the development of the Cardano blockchain, among other projects. IOG takes a scientific, peer-reviewed approach to blockchain development and has collaborations with multiple academic institutions. The rebranding to IOG reflects the company's global presence and ambition, moving beyond its initial association with Hong Kong.

### Nix build system:

Nix is a powerful and purely functional package manager. The Nix build system allows developers to manage dependencies and build software in consistent and reproducible environments. The environment is determined by a Nix expression, and every build runs in isolation from other builds, ensuring there are no unexpected interactions.

### IOG Binary Caches:

When building and deploying software with Nix, it often requires downloading and compiling many dependencies, which can be time-consuming. A binary cache is a pre-built cache of these dependencies. Instead of building everything from source, developers and users can download the pre-compiled binaries from the binary cache, significantly speeding up the build and deployment process.

IOG provides their binary caches to aid in the development and deployment of their projects, including Cardano. By using IOG's binary caches, developers working on IOG projects can quickly get the required dependencies without compiling them from source. This is especially helpful in CI/CD environments where build speed is crucial.

### Why use IOG Binary Caches?

1. **Speed**: Fetching pre-built binaries is faster than compiling from source.
2. **Consistency**: Ensures all developers and CI/CD systems use the same pre-built binaries, aiding in reproducibility.
3. **Ease**: Reduces complexity for new developers or users setting up the project. They don't have to worry about specific build dependencies and configurations.
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Fetching binaries saves computational resources that would otherwise be used for building.

In conclusion, IOG's Binary Caches play a crucial role in the efficient and consistent development and deployment of IOG's projects, ensuring a smooth development process and a consistent experience for everyone involved. If the statement you provided is accurate, then developers should refer to IOG as the new trusted source for these binary caches.
