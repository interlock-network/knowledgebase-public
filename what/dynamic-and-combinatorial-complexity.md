# Dynamic and Combinatorial Complexity

While each of these complexity-types deserve their own entry,
it is important to keep in mind what makes these complexity-types
different from each other.

Systems can be either complex or simple. If they are complex, they
are often confusing and difficult to understand. There are two kinds
of complexity that make it challenging to understand a system --
combinatorial and dynamic complexity.

A system with combinatorial complexity is a system that has simple
mechanics, but the sheer number of discrete mechanical combinations
results in a "needle in a haystack" situation. For example most
game-theoretic systems (like chess) exhibit this kind of complexity.
Tick-tack-toe _would_ have this complexity, if the rules were a little
more complex, and if the number of squares was 9x9 instead of 3x3.

A system with dynamic complexity is a system that actually has reasonably
simple mechanics (few moving parts), but _many_ possible _states_. For
example, a simple system involving an assembly line for (for example)
automobiles, is very dynamically-complex because of the feedback-delays
between different phases of the assembly-process, as well as various
supply-chain-shocks (which are themselves examples of a dynamically-complex
system -- a giant, global assembly line, that has the simple purpose of
turning minerals and resources into self-propelled, high-velocity, horseless
carriages).

These seemingly linear systems, actually involve feedbacks between all
phases, making them -- in actuality -- non-linear. These feedbacks are
create a large number of hard-to-predict states -- in large part --
because there is a latency/delay between an event, and the rippling of
that event through the system. For example, a speculative bubble
involves a feedback latency between demand and price. If there was _zero_
latency, a bubble would never happen, and the efficient-market-hypothesis
would be unquestionably true (which it is not).
