# Request for Discussions

Inspired by the RFC process and the RFD process used by Joyent.
It differed in that it was powered by [discourse](./discourse.md)
instead of git, and discussions happened in a central place (as
opposed to ad-hoc (and often private) email and slack discussions).

It was a huge step up from random slack questions. Unfortunately,
that system (and all its data) are gone. However, it has spurred the
creation of this knowledge-base, which actively separates the discussion
aspect of things from the article/content aspect.

We carry out discussions in github-discussions, primarily because it is
easy to reference issues, and specific articles in the repo (from
the discussions and vice-versa).
