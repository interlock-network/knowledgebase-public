# Interlock Extension

Our extension. It uses a [visual-threat-indcator](./visual-threat-indicator.md)
to determine if a website is dangerous/fraudulent, and -- if it is -- the
extension blocks any inputs to the webpage, unless a user unlocks the page.
The unlock-event gets sent to our servers for inspection.

It is based on [uBlock](./ublock.md), so the user gets ad-blocking for free.
