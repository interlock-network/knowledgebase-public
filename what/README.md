# What

This is where we store articles about things and concepts. For example,
this directory should contain articles named `uBlock`, `Apozy`, `Interlock`,
`Wormhole`, `Solana`, `AWS`, `GCP`, `Manifest-V2`, `Manifest-V3`, etc. It
should also contain general articles like `ad-blocker`, `phishing`,
`spear-phishing`, `malvertising`, etc. It should not contain articles that
would conflict with other correlatives like `who/`, `how/`, etc.
