# Obsidian

A markdown-based knowledge-base (or second-brain), [obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
indexes any markdown directories, and lets you jump between markdown-files that
are linked or share a tag. It has a kick-ass graph-view.

There are 2 extensions you will need:

If you want Obsidian to understand both Markdown _and_ Orgmode:
https://github.com/ryanpcmcquen/obsidian-org-mode .

If you want the Obsidian-links (they are like wikipedia links) to be
rendered on github properly:
https://github.com/dy-sh/obsidian-consistent-attachments-and-links

One of the issues with Obsidian is in the graph-view: it uses only
the file-name as a node-name, which means that 2 nodes in 2 different
directories (i.e. which/blockchain and what/blockchain) both have the
name `blockchain`. That said, it is possible to filter the nodes via
path-prefixes. Also, see the Obsidian [forums](https://forum.obsidian.md)
for lively discussion on how to organize a second brain.
