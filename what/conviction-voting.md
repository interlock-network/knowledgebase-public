# Conviction Voting

A voting method developed by [blockscience](../who/blockscience.md).
It gives larger weights to votes that have been held for longer.
So if you flip-flop on a vote, your accumulated voting power drops to
one. This is meant to counter-act last-minute election-manipulation.
Additionally, this mitigates sybil-attacks, and does so without asking
you to reveal and prove your identity.

Additionally it is a continuous process. Unlike every other method
where there is a fixed window in which one votes, this process has no
windows. You are voting _all the time_. This means that you can let
a vote on an issue last for a very long time (weeks or months), and
see what decision-ratios the community converges on.

This also means that there is no risk of someone missing a vote.
It has the potential to mitigate low-participation-rates by giving
people ample time start participating.

Conviction Voting is how we will do our own governance-voting. Other
methods have too many flaws. In a sense conviction-voting is a little like
karma on HN (you tend to have more if you have been around a long time).
