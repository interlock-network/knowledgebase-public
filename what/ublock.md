# uBlock

An extension made by Raymond Hill, that is the best ad-blocker available.
Our [extension](./interlock-extension.md) is based on this. In recent
years, browsers have started neutering themselves, so that uBlock and
similar extensions cannot work. Safari cannot run it, and it looks like
Chrome will soon be unable to run it, because of [Manifest V3](./manifest-v3.md).

One of our chores is to periodically sync our fork of the extension, with
upstream, which is a pain in the ass -- any ideas to streamline this process
would be appreciated.
