# Manifest V3

This is the latest standard for WebKit extensions, that is also
supported by Firefox. It generated controversy for deprecating
APIs required for blocking ads (ostensibly, to protect users from
mallicious extensions). In future versions, Chrome will
be unable to run the [uBlock](./ublock.md) extension. Firefox
will support those APIs in spite of what the standard says.
Curiously, Chrome is not deprecating the APIs for its Enterprise
version -- one would think that Enterprise Customers would want
some of that supposed protection.
