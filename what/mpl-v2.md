# MPL v2

The latest license from Mozilla. It is a like a hybrid between the
BSD license and the GPL license. The GPL license has a very broad
definition of "derivative work", and BSD does not care about derivatives
at all. The MPL v2 considers the modification _of individual files_,
as derivative, but nothing else (so you can add custom files, and that
would be fine). Only real issue with it, is that it has been designed
for an older pre-Cloud Era. See [EUPL](./eupl.md) and [AGPL](./agpl.md).
