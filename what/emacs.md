# Emacs
An unreasonably powerful and capable editor. It is basically a Lisp Machine
disguised as a text editor. It is light-weight compared to other modern
editors (i.e. Atom or VSCode), and has many features and capabilities.
Its killer feature, in our experience, is the MAGIT plugin -- which makes
it much less maddening to use git (compared to the CLI).
