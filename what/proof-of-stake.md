# Proof of Stake
An alternative to [Proof of Work](./proof-of-work.md), used to achieve consensus
on the credibility of transactions. In short, the amount of money you have staked
is correlated to your voting power. If you approve a credible transaction,
you get to collect a fee. If you approve a non-credible transaction, you lose a
significant portion of your stake (the fees are always smaller than the staked amount).
This protects the network from [Sybil Attacks](./sybil-attack.md), but it does
mean that someone without regard for their staked money (i.e. nation state actors)
could attack the network and even control if they are willing to lose a lot of
money.

Also, Proof of Stake performs better than Proof of Work, making transactions-per-second(TPS)
go from the dozens to the thousands (even many thousands). However, this is nothing
in comparison to the TPS that can be achieved by a large computer or rack running
in the basement of a bank or stock-exchange somewhere.

Nevertheless, this is how disruptive innovation works -- see SSDs vs HDDs, for
example, or Hydraulic Excavators vs Cable Excavators.
