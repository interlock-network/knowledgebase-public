# Staking
Related to [proof of stake](./proof-of-stake.md),
staking is a way to vouch for something with your money,
and earn a small return on that money, if your claim is
verified as correct/truthful.

If it is verified as being false, your stake is confiscated.
There are numerous ways to do staking, like quadratic-staking,
and so on.
