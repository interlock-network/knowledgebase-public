# Linkbot

This file is for describing what the Linkbot is. "Linkbot" is a working name. It is explained in more detail in the [Linkbot repo](https://github.com/interlock-network/linkbot).

Our latest description:

Interlock’s Linkbot scans every link posted to Discord for privacy and security risks. If it detects an unsafe link, it'll label it unsafe and post it as a string instead of a link for transparency. Future versions will have options to autoban users who post unsafe links as well as other moderation features.

Linkbot is powered by Interlock’s proprietary database of unsafe URLs and ‘point-of-click’ ML analysis of novel websites.

Unlike Meebot, you don't have to do any custom scripting with Linkbot -- your server will instantly be protected out of the box from both novel and known malicious links.
