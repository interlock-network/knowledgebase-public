# Engineer Onboarding

To onboard engineers:

  - ask them to find the difference between our extension and ublock
    before giving them access to any git repos or internal documentation
  - ask them to update the knowledge-base with an article about themselves
    in `who/` and about something technological that they like in `what/`.
  - ask them to setup local ethereum, solana, and wormhole development nodes
    (and to document their steps for their system -- i.e. mac, linux, whatever)
  - ask them create a jupyter notebook that runs a cadCAD sim of something that
    interests them (it could be anything from simple predator-prey-models to
    more complex models that simulate/confirm/refute post-keynesian assumptions
    -- if that is too economic/financial, then a model that simulates fluctuations
    in sales of RAM, HDDs, SSDs, as the price-per-byte a price-per-IOPS rises
    or falls)
  - ask them to get the extension running locally, with the Google Chrome Account
    disabled (they will have to modify the code before it starts running).
  - ask them to implement stub-code for a new feature (in any of our code)
  - ask them to sync the extension with uBlock (so that we are using the most recent
    uBlock code as possible).
  - ask them if they know the meaning of life.
