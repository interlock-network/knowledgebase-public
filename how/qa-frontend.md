# Quality Control Checklist for Frontend
- Spelling
- Search results correct and relevant
- Apply all checks: Readability in Light Mode
- Apply all checks: Readability in Dark Mode
- Apply all checks: Mobile views are usable and easy to navigate, try to avoid horizontal scrolling.
- Apply all checks: Using network throttling to simulate slow loading and ensure loading states on long / slow apis are obvious.
- Menus are appropriate and work in mobile and desktop.
- Clicking every button works as expected.
- Page state is saved as expected after refreshing a page. For example, changing number of total items in a table and refreshing the page remembers the number of items shown. This should be true for all user-selectable view preferences.
- Spacing and alignment is consistent and even.
- Success actions are clear and easy to associate with the action-at-hand.
- Error actions are clear and easy to associate with the action-at-hand.
- Inputs correctly handle unexpected input and appropriate input length.
- Click-spamming a button or action does not break anything. For example, clicking the ‘Save’ button as fast as you can.
- Confusing items all have appropriate tooltips.
- When a list or page has no items, a friendly empty-state display is shown (check in both light vs dark).
- All important actions (saving settings, blocking a person, adding a group…etc) create an appropriate Activity Notification.
- Components look consistent across pages (button sizes, color, shadows, etc).
- Animations are smooth
- Visual weight is appropriate between items and overall page focuses attention on most relevant parts first with size and color distinction (visual hierarchy).
- Top menu has group names properly selected on each group page.
- Side navigation pages are properly highlighted for the selected group page.
- Page titles are correct for every page.
- Sorting on all table components works as expected.
- Default sort order for table components are correct for data shown.
- Sidebar counters update properly (when an alert is opened or closed) in sidebar nav.
- Opening a drop-down menu properly shows the current selection with a check mark next to it.
