# How

This is where we store guides, tutorials, and how-to's. If you
want to know how to compile-and-test the extension in goes in this category.
How to access our AWS services, how to do something on github, how to test
or run the pipeline, all can be found here. If you already have instructions
stored in the software's repo (or in the official documentation of a service
(i.e. AWS, Stripe)) then you can link to that, instead. If you think it is valuable
enough to be duplicated (just in case) feel free to do so (but start a discussion
before duplicating anything substantial).
