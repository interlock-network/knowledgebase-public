# How to Track and Document expenses

Tracking and documenting expenses is required for tax deductability and expensing. Please read the general information regarding how and why here https://github.com/ComplianceOnline/Travel-and-Expense-Policy.

## For Interlock the general guidelines are:
1. Meals under 75$ should not be expensed to the company account
2. Specific purpose transactions for things like online services do not need to be expensed.
3. All discretionary spending needs to be documented (who, what, where, why and when) and its reciept uploaded in [Brex](https://brex.com)

### Explainations
1. Meals under 75$ are not considered significant enough for tax purposes
2. Specific transtions can be looked up on the internet to disertain their purpose, for example, `trello.com` can easily be looked up and it has a single purpose as `productivity software`.
3. Discretionary transactions like random stuff from `amazon.com` do not have a specific purpose that can be looked up. For tax reasons and to prevent fraud they should be fully documented.

## Traditional Expensing

Traditionally expensing occurs when an employee is reimbursed for a business expense using personal funds. This is style of reimbursment is discouraged.

## Interlock Expensing

Interlock uses a service called [Brex](https://brex.com) to provide people with either budget based virtual cards, or single-purchase virtual cards. These are granted through a login via the Brex admin console. After making a purchase the person must properly report the expense according to the above guidelines.
