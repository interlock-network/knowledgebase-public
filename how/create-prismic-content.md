-   Creating Pages & Blog Posts in Prismic
    -   Pages
        -   All pages have a `title`, which shows up as the browser tab title, and the website slug, which is the page's unique ID, or `uid`.
        -   The rest of the page is built from components, or slices, in Prsimic's slice zone. The full list of usable components and examples can be found at [apozy.com/usable-components](http://apozy.com/usable-components), and example setups are in the corresponding page in the Prismic dashboard.
        -   Tags: In the Prismic dashboard, you can add or create tags for each document. Right now, they are only used for searching the Prismic [Documents view](https://airlock.prismic.io/documents/working/) and retrieving the homepage in NextJS.
        -   To create a page, click the pencil button in the upper right corner of the [Documents view](https://airlock.prismic.io/documents/working/)
    -   Blog Posts: uses Blog Post, Author, & Blog Post CTA custom types.
        -   Blog Post

            -   The Blog Post CTA has its own custom type in Prismic, because it would be redundant to add the same CTA section as a slice or with added fields in a Blog Post type. You can search for the Blog Post CTA by Custom type in the [Documents view](https://airlock.prismic.io/documents/working/) and change the fields accordingly there.
        -   Fields
            -   Editor Title - for clarity in Prismic Toolbar

            -   Secondary Button Link
-   Changing the Navbar or Footer
    -   The Apozy website's Navbar consists of the Desktop Menu, Mobile Menu, and Dropdown Menus custom types.
    -   Desktop Menu
        -   Contains links for the navbar, not including dropdowns.
        -   Fields
            -   Editor Title - for clarity in Prismic Toolbar
            -   Editor Description - for clarity in Prismic Toolbar
            -   Logo - appears in the upper left corner of the navbar
        -   Slices:
            -   Secondary Nav - Appears in the upper right corner of the navbar.
                -   Fields
                    -   Link Text
                    -   Link
                    -   Sign Up - boolean. If a secondary nav link is a sign up link, it will be styled differently than the rest of the links in the desktop menu.
            -   Primary Nav - Appears in the center of the desktop menu. These links contain dropdown containers that are set up in the Dropdown Menus custom type.
                -   Fields
                    -   Title
                    -   Label - this label MUST match the label of the corresponding dropdown menu, or else the dropdown menu will not function.
    -   The Mobile Menu and Dropdown Menus are both constructed using the method in [this Prismic Guide](https://user-guides.prismic.io/en/articles/2888625-creating-a-3-level-navigation-menu). They have slice zones with slices that have different levels. All slices of level n must be placed under a slice of level n-1.
        -   You would have a list of slices something like this:
            -   1st Level (1A)
            -   2nd level (2A)
            -   2nd level (2B)
            -   1st level (1B)
            -   2nd level (2C)
            -   2nd level (2D)
            -   2nd level (2E)
            -   And so on...
        -   In the application, these slices would then be parsed and grouped according to the top-most level (1A-2B is one group, 1B-2E is another group).
        -   There was no way to set levels in the custom type so you must set the level according to the specifications below every time you create a new slice.
