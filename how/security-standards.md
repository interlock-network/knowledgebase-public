# Security Standards 


## Password ##
[Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/) password for every login possible. 
Use the yubikey in a way that it creates a salt and combine that salt with a secure password you remember. 
Ex: Salt+My$ecureFBPass for a Facebook password. 
This would end up being something like 40 characters. 
Yubikeys also work on a phone if it has NFC. Look into which have NFC.
(Contact Treva if you need one and we can purchase it for you.)  

**Passwords should be changed every 45-75 days**

Check with Erhan and nick about how they currently do this, and how we should continue going forward, but I believe its each person’s own account. Check. 
We need to establish access control for data, etc. Coordinate with nick, shivam, on this.
