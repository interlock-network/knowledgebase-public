[Halborn](https://halborn.com/) is a potential auditor for us.

### Background

`Award-winning ethical blockchain hackers to secure your stack end-to-end. Far beyond smart contracts.`

They're about two years old and have 80-90 engineers around the US.

### Process

They look at our blockchain at 90% complete and give us an estimate within 24-48 hours.

Two weeks before starting the audit, we give them charts, diagrams, and a video walk through -- like what we'd use to onboard a new engineer.

They can do the actual audit when our codebase is 99% done and let us know about any security vulnerabilities.

After we fix any vulnerabilities, if we give them permission, Halborn conducts active pen testing to check if everything is fixed.

### Result

Halborn finishes by writing a public report detailing any remaining risks. See the [Thorstarter report](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity%20Smart%20Contract%20Audits/Thorstarter_Governance_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_v1_1.pdf) for an example.

We can also put Halborn on retainer to audit our code on an ongoing basis.
