# Who

This is where we store articles about relevant (or not so relevant) people.
For example, all current and former Interlock employees belong here.
Also any people that we have met, or that we know of (i.e. founders/engineers
at competing or adjecent companies). Also, company-articles belong here
(i.e. github-the-company goes here, while github-the-product goes under `what`).
